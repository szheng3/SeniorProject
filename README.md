# Branch: branchByAlex
This branch utilizes the more recent releases of JDK, JBoss, and Javax than what is currently used on the master branch.
On this branch, the more recent releases reduce the number of external libraries needed in our project down to only one,
verses the more than five external dependencies of the master branch (Spring, Commons-IO, Commons-FileUtils, JUnit, JavaX).
